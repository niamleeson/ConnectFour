# Jay's Connect Four Game

The application is built with Ruby on Rails framework and Ember JavaScript framework.

Currently, the player's color is red and the computer's color is yellow,
but the functionality to change this will be added in the future.

A player is able to save the current game or load up a past saved game,
but to enable this functionality, the player must sign in or sign up initially.
A saved game is also able to be deleted.

Features to be included in the future:

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Ability to let the connect four bot to start first.
=======
* Ability to let the computer start first.

* A form to update a user's info.

* Extensive user sign up form validations.

* Ability to select different colors.

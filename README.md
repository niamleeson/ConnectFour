# Jay's Connect Four Game

The application is built with Ruby on Rails framework and Ember JavaScript framework.

A player is able to select a difficulty for the connect four "bot", which is technically a brute force algorithm called minimax.
Higher difficulty will lead to slower server response time due to the depth of trees the algorithm needs to go through.

Currently, the player's color is red and the computer's color is yellow,
but the functionality to change this will be added in the future.

A player is able to save the current game or load up a past saved game,
but to enable this functionality, the player must sign in or sign up initially.
A saved game is also able to be deleted.

Features to be included in the future:

* Ability to let the connect four bot to start first.

* Replay functionality to watch any past games.

* A form to update a user's info.

* Extensive user sign up form validations.

* Ability to select different colors.

* And definitely more comments in the code are needed.
